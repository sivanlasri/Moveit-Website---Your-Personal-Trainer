/* 
  Styles for the #headstart and #programs sections:
  These sections are designed as large, full viewport height containers 
  that center their content both vertically and horizontally using flexbox.
  The text inside is large, black with a subtle white glow for emphasis.
  Negative margins adjust the vertical positioning to overlap or shift the sections visually.
  The font 'Rock Salt' is applied for a handwritten, casual style.
  
  Additionally, all <a> links are styled to have no underline and inherit
  the surrounding text color for a cleaner look.
